	Delos Welltek Australia (“Delos,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is committed to protecting your
	privacy and the data on the DARWIN™ app (the “DARWIN app”). To demonstrate this
	commitment, we have adopted this privacy policy (this “Policy”). The Policy is designed to
	help you understand generally how the DARWIN app collects, uses or discloses
	information about you. Your use of the DARWIN app is subject to this Policy and our Terms
	of Use; by accessing the DARWIN app you acknowledge and agree to accept this Policy,
	which we may amend at any time. If we update this Policy, we will post the updated Policy
	here. Any such changes will be effective upon posting. You should consult the “Privacy
	Policy” on the DARWIN app periodically.
	The DARWIN Ecosystem is a wellness intelligence platform incorporating science-based
	technologies and solutions designed to enhance physical and emotional well-being in
	homes. DARWIN creates and maintains the natural environment in your home that is
	essential for enhanced health, wellbeing and performance. Based on the learnings gained
	from over 7 years with the foremost medical and scientific institutions in the world, the
	DARWIN platform monitors the health of your home to meet the needs of occupants.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">I. NOTICE OF OUR POLICY</span></br></br>
	This Policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you and why,
	how we may use or disclose that information, and how you can update your information.
	Please read this Policy carefully, and feel free to contact us at privacy.dwa@delos.com.au
	if you have questions about this Policy or if you would like to update information you have
	provided to us.
	Please note that this Policy applies only to the DARWIN app, and not to any other
	application or website linked to the DARWIN app, including any social media websites
	linked to the DARWIN app, or any other interaction with Welltek. We do not control the
	privacy policies or practices of others. We encourage you to ask questions and read the
	privacy policies of other websites and application before you disclose any personal
	information to them.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">II. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION ARE COLLECTED AND WHY?</span></br></br>
	Welltek may collect personally identifiable information or non-personally identifiable
	information through your use of the DARWIN app. Personally identifiable information (or
	personal information) is information that personally identifies you, such as your name,
	postal address and email address, and non-personally identifiable information is
	information that does not personally identify you, including anonymous information and
	aggregated data about users of the DARWIN app. Information is collected in order to
	provide services to you, tailor services to you based on your preferences and display
	information to you about the environment inside your home, as well as to improve our
	services and offerings and for other general research purposes. Information can be
	collected if you submit it to us or it may be collected automatically through technology. The
	DARWIN app uses information it collects in order to recognize and identify the property,
	sensors and other appliances and products in your home, and collect data generated from
	those sensors and other appliances and products. We also may use your personal
	information to respond to your requests and provide support, to communicate with you, to 
	provide updates to you about relevant products and services, and otherwise provide our
	products and services to you.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">a. Information submitted by you</span></br></br>
	You may submit information to us when you use the DARWIN app. For
	instance, you may submit information in order to authenticate your credentials
	and input your preferences including your name, email address, social
	connection (single sign on user option), log-in and password credentials
	created by you, additional users that may access the DARWIN app, your
	preferences, your favorites, your schedule, and other information you provide
	to help us customize our services for you and optimize system performance.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">b. Location Information</span></br></br>
	You may submit location information, including your time zone and address, in
	your preferences and certain location information may be collected
	automatically by using the DARWIN app such as Internet Protocol address,
	street address (including city, state, territory and postcode), and the products
	and appliances in your home compatible with the DARWIN app. Time zone
	and location data is used to customize settings in your home, such as triggering
	dawn simulation and controlling other lighting timers. By registering and using
	the DARWIN app, you consent to such collection and use of this information.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">c. Device and environmental information collected automatically</span></br></br>
	The DARWIN app recognizes devices in your home that you choose to connect
	to the DARWIN app and collects information about those devices to display the
	information to you so that you can better understand the environment inside
	your home. Whenever you select to activate devices via the DARWIN app, we
	automatically receive and record information on our servers, logs and
	databases from the DARWIN app or device(s). In particular, the DARWIN app
	is designed to allow you to connect various devices you choose to connect in
	your home (for example your lighting, HVAC system, and/or water filter) to the
	DARWIN app. While connected to the DARWIN app, these devices
	automatically report information to our servers, logs and databases (including
	information you may have provided when setting up the devices or the
	DARWIN app). For instance, if you connect an indoor environmental quality
	(“IEQ”) sensor to the DARWIN app and activate the IEQ portion of the DARWIN
	app, the IEQ data (along with other information such as applicable room,
	device name and location) will be transmitted and displayed to you via the
	DARWIN app. Specifically, your home contains sensors to help you monitor
	the environment in your home. Some information the DARWIN app collects
	from your sensors and displays for you on the DARWIN app if you activate this
	feature include temperature, relative humidity and air quality conditions, such
	as Particulate Matter 10, Particulate Matter 2.5, carbon dioxide, total volatile
	organic compounds, temperature and humidity.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">d. Use of Non-personal information and aggregated data</span></br></br>
	The DARWIN app collects data about your use of the DARWIN app such as
	commands triggered and other DARWIN app usage metrics. Welltek may use
	non-personally identifiable information and anonymized, aggregated data to
	understand better how the DARWIN app is used, including average time spent
	using the DARWIN app and pages viewed, to provide users with customized
	services and information, and to gather other relevant statistics and
	information. Welltek collects this information to measure the use of the
	DARWIN app and to improve the content of the DARWIN app. Such
	information, and other information we derive from an individual user’s
	information, supports our continued research, and allows us to continue to
	grow and improve our services and products.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">e. Information collected by technology</span></br></br>
	Welltek and its agents use technologies like cookies to help you use our
	services more easily and help us continuously improve the DARWIN app and
	our services. Personal and non-personal information that may be collected
	using such technologies may include IP addresses, time spent on the DARWIN
	app, location information and a user’s internet service provider. A “cookie” is a
	small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be
	stored on your hard drive to help the website “remember” information about
	you when you return to the website, such as your preferences for the website
	or account identifications. We use simple session based cookies for logged in
	users on the website linked to the DARWIN app to track active sessions. You
	may have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies; however, doing
	so may affect the performance of the DARWIN app or restrict the way in which
	we may provide our services to you.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">III. HOW DOES WELLTEK DISCLOSE MY INFORMATION?</span></br></br>
			We may disclose your personal information to our affiliates and other entities and individuals we engage to perform functions on our behalf and to help us to operate the DARWIN app and our business and deliver our services to you, or we may disclose information if you consent to such disclosure. Some of these other entities and individuals may include technology and other consultants, attorneys, accountants, clerical staff, website or database hosting companies, service and technical support companies, analytics companies, e-commerce providers and financial institutions (for the purpose of processing credit card transactions in the event you make a purchase from the DARWIN app). These entities and individuals will have access to your personal information to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside of Australia, including the United States, the European Economic Area and India.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">IV. HOW CAN I OPT-OUT OF RECEIVING EMAIL COMMUNICATION?</span></br></br>
	We may email you in order to notify you of changes or offer you services we think you may
	be interested in. We will not send unsolicited messages to you if you indicate that you do
	not wish to receive such messages. However, if you, as a user, do not want your personal
	information used as otherwise detailed in this Policy, then you must not use the DARWIN
	app.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">V. SECURITY</span></br></br>
	The security of your information is important to us, and we endeavor to protect your
	personal information. However, there is no such thing as perfect security on the Internet,
	and you provide personal information to us at your own risk. Welltek expressly disclaims
	all liability for any damages, losses or claims of any kind relating to any personal
	information that you provide to us or others through the DARWIN app. When you use the
	DARWIN app, we encourage you to protect your information and use precautions,
	including but not limited to, using strong passwords and not sharing your password and
	account information with any other person.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">VI. INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN</span></br></br>
	This DARWIN app is not directed to children (persons under 15 years of age), and Welltek
	does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If a child under 15 has
	provided personally identifiable information to us through the DARWIN app, a parent or
	guardian may inform us at the address for notices below, and we will use commercially
	reasonable efforts to delete it from our database, subject to applicable law and this Policy.</br></br>
	<span class="clr3 mw">VII. HOW CAN I UPDATE MY INFORMATION, ASK A QUESTION OR ISSUE A COMPLAINT?</span></br></br>
	You can always update your account information or correct information you provided
	through profile settings in the DARWIN app, and if you require further assistance, please
	visit delos.com.au/support. To ask any questions or submit a complaint about this Policy
	and information handling, please contact us at privacy.dwa@delos.com.au,1-3000-
